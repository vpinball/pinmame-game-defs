# Creature From The Black Lagoon

Coverage: **partial - source-derived recreation knowledge requiring validation**

## Overview

Legacy evidence identifies this candidate as Bally (1992). The information below is preserved for recreation work but is not automatically treated as validated physical-machine fact.

## Playfield devices

Switch, lamp/GI, and controlled-device candidates are in the adjacent machine definition. Source-specific implementation notes are retained below.

## Custom mechanisms

No custom mechanism conclusion has been validated. Manuals, schematics, PinMAME source, and gameplay evidence still need to be checked.

## Ball-state transitions

Ball paths, trough ordering, locks, kickouts, and causal transitions have not yet been normalized. Relevant source notes follow under Evidence notes.

## Controller interactions

Controller callbacks and bindings are candidate evidence only until reconciled against PinMAME and physical documentation.

## Service and setup information

Unknown; locate operator/service documentation.

## Timing and tuning observations

Source timing values may describe a particular VPX implementation rather than physical hardware and require review.

## Recreation guidance

Do not treat this partial definition as a complete authoring specification. Resolve every coverage requirement and conflict before promotion.

## Evidence notes

- `platforms/wpc.json#/coils/1`: Unbound legacy outputs record `c_flipper_lower_right` was retained as a migration note only.
- `platforms/wpc.json#/coils/2`: Unbound legacy outputs record `c_flipper_lower_left` was retained as a migration note only.
- `platforms/wpc.json#/coils/3`: Unbound legacy outputs record `c_flipper_upper_right` was retained as a migration note only.
- `platforms/wpc.json#/coils/4`: Unbound legacy outputs record `c_flipper_upper_left` was retained as a migration note only.

## Unresolved questions

- Is the I/O enumeration complete for every supported physical/controller variant?
- Which inferred VPX behaviors reflect real hardware, and which are table-script conveniences?
- Are all mechanism home states, sensors, motion constraints, and ball interactions documented?
